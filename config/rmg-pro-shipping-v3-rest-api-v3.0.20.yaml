  title: Royal Mail API Shipping V3 (REST)
  description: "API Shipping V3 (REST) provides the functionality for customers to
    take a shipping transaction from creation to collection. \n\nIt specifically covers
    how the Royal Mail API Shipping V3 can be used by business customers to conduct
    shipping activity with Royal Mail and provides the technical information to build
    this integration. This specification must be used with the relevant accompanying
    specifications for customers wishing to interface their systems with Royal Mail
    services.\n\nRoyal Mail API Shipping V3 exposes a fully RESTful service that allows
    account customers to create shipments, produce labels, and produce documentation
    for all the tasks required to ship domestic and international items with Royal
    Mail.\n\nBuilt on industry standards, Royal Mail API Shipping V3 provides a simple
    and low cost method for customers to integrate with Royal Mail, and allows them
    to get shipping quickly. The API offers data streaming to allow customers greater
    flexibility when generating their labels. There are no costs to customers for
    using the Royal Mail API Shipping V3 services, however customers??? own development
    costs must be covered by the customer developing the solution. Royal Mail will
    not accept any responsibility for these development, implementation and testing
    costs. Customers should address initial enquiries regarding development of systems
    for these purposes to their account handler.\n\nThis API can be used in conjunction
    with Royal Mail Pro Shipping, a GUI based shipping platform. For more details
    on Royal Mail Pro Shipping, including videos on and briefs on updating/ cancelling
    a shipment and Manifesting please refer to http://www.royalmail.com/pro-shipping-help."
